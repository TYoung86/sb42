<p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer
third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have

<p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by

<a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548">AdWords Policy Support Answers at Google</a>.</p>

<p>We have not enabled Google AdSense on our site but we may do
so in the future.</p>

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>

<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's
reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a
conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being
collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.</p>

<p>More information at <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/">Consumer Federation of California on CalOPPA</a></p>

<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on
our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our
website.</li>
<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can be
easily be found on the page specified above.</li>
<li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page.</li>
<li>You can change your personal information by logging in to your account.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>

<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant
cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in
place.</p>

<h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>

<p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party
behavioral tracking</p>

<h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>

<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from
children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission,
United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
children's privacy and safety online.</p>

<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of
13 years old.</p>

<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>

<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone
of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
personal information.</p>

<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we
will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>

<ul>
<li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</li>
<li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 3
business days.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which
requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against
data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
